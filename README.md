Features: 

Red fade/intensity on DMX channel 1
Green fade/intensity on DMX channel 2
Blue fade/intensity on DMX channel 3
White fade/intensity on DMX channel 4
Amber fade/intensity on DMX channel 5
UV fade/intensity on DMX channel 6
Global fade/intensity on DMX channel 7
Strobe rate on DMX channel 8

Channel numbers easily changed as they're defined as variables, all are relative to the start channel set as a variable.
